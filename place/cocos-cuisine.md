  text: Would like to recommend Coco’s Cuisine Mcr - based in prestwich for delivery
    and she has a separate vegan menu. We ordered on Christmas Eve and again tonight
    so have now eaten our way through most of the vegan menu. The foccacia, tagliatelle,
    shepherds pie and all of the deserts have been spot on in particular 👌🏻

  text: We got a Coco's last night and it was delicious! We had the shepherds pie,
    gnocci, banoffee pud and the cheesecake and all were really good. Especially the
    banoffee, oh my days. We'll definitely be ordering again sometime soon.
