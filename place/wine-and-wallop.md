  text: Not an easy subject to photograph, the olâ€™ vegan burger. Look at that healthy
    sized portion of chips though! NGL, the removal of half the vegan options at @wineandwallop_prestwich
    after the rebrand stung but itâ€™s a decent burger and a nice atmosphere in the
    afternoons.

  text: Managed to pop over to Folk (on bury new road, where solita used to be) today
    for lunch. They have a few good options for us and cake! Nice atmosphere, friendly
    staff. We'll definitely be back.

**December 2022:** Wine & Wallop have re-added the vegan burger and vegan breakfast to their menu!

**June 2022:** Wine & Wallop no longer do the vegan burger, or any vegan hot meals ðŸ˜”

**UPDATE 2022: 'Folk' is now called 'Wine and Wallop', with a smaller vegan menu**

When they'd just opened it felt like orders got mixed up fairly often and the service was pretty haphazard, but lately we've had no problems on that front - at least at lunch time on a weekday!"
