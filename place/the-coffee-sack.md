  text: new vegan menu items at Coffee Sack! We both tried the new spiced dahl, on
    toast and on a jacket potato. It was well fit! I was saying to my wife, Coffee
    Sack is one of the only places where I'm never disappointed to see menu changes,
    cause every new thing they come up with is dee-lish

  text: They have also massively upped their game with the cakes they offer now. It
    use to be a gluten free muffin. This time they had about 5 options. They arenâ€™t
    labelled as vegan but if you ask they will let you know. We love it here.

  text: Weâ€™ve not been over to @coffeesackprestwich for a little bit so were excited
    to find they have new vegan options! We tried the BBQ pulled jackfruit toast topper
    and jacket potato filling. Really nice and as usual the salad and vegan coleslaw
    was fresh and delicious. Great coffee too! It is in the name after all.

  text: We had lunch at the Coffee Sack today - their new spiced chickpea salad stuff
    is lush! They've got a full vegan menu (you gotta ask for it) and the coffee and
    cakes are always A++ too. Highly recommend checking them out

  text: New fave! Cauliflower and vegan halloumi salad from @coffeesackprestwich-
    you have to ask for vegan halloumi, which comes nicely crisped up. Yum!

  text: Did you know @coffeesackprestwich now do vegan cakes? Usually one or two different
    options every time we go there these days. As big cake fanatics weâ€™re glad to
    be able to get a fix at one of our favorite spots!

  text: 'Swung by @thecoffeesack this afternoon for lunch, just in time to try their
    new vegan option: smashed chickpea salad! Very tasty. Itâ€™s replacing the falafel
    wrap on their menu, but fear not! Your can sell get falafel as an extra. Theyâ€™re
    also having a separate vegan menu printed as we speak, hopefully thatâ€™ll be available
    next time weâ€™re there. A very considerate step and we love to see it ðŸ’š'
