  text: I went to Croma yesterday for the first time in ages after I spotted they've
    got two vegan pizzas on their menu now. I had the bruschetta starter, and then
    the Carciolo pizza with artichokes and vegan cheese, and the salted caramel icecream
    after. Not too shabby at all! And the service was fast and friendly, too.
