[October 2023:](https://dumpoir.com/c/5382484333733658123) "Went to Tito’s for tea for the first time in a while. Forgot to take pictures of most of the food - it was too tasty to wait!"

[December 2020:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/1282425088801571/?comment_id=1282461472131266) "Oh my. You must add ‘Tito’s Asian Grill’ on there for eating in / takeout. Their food is incredible. They accommodated six of us who were all vegan and all wanted different dishes off the menu. The guy we spoke to (who I think was the owner) knew every single dish inside out, and really left me feeling confident they knew what they were talking about. Not to mention, it was absolutely banging."

[January 2020:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/1011984612512288/) "We checked out Tito's Grill tonight and have to say it was fabulous. As soon as we said we were vegan they were extremely helpful and informative. They had loads of options and are planning on expanding the menu, including adding a separate vegan menu. Very good news! And they have a deal on at the moment so our bill was under £30 including drinks, mains, and poppadoms. Even better!"

I had masala dosa and manchurian cauliflower for starters. Great flavours and textures. Then mushroom rice and a veggie curry. They had a lovely selection of vegetables in the curry rather than the usual menu standard ones. It was nice to be able to try different kinds of rice too. 😋" ... "They were lovely and really helpful!"
