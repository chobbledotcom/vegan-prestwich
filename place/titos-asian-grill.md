  text: Oh my. You must add â€˜Titoâ€™s Asian Grillâ€™ on there for eating in / takeout.
    Their food is incredible. They accommodated six of us who were all vegan and all
    wanted different dishes off the menu. The guy we spoke to (who I think was the
    owner) knew every single dish inside out, and really left me feeling confident
    they knew what they were talking about. Not to mention, it was absolutely banging.

  text: We checked out Tito's Grill tonight and have to say it was fabulous. As soon
    as we said we were vegan they were extremely helpful and informative. They had
    loads of options and are planning on expanding the menu, including adding a separate
    vegan menu. Very good news! And they have a deal on at the moment so our bill
    was under Â£30 including drinks, mains, and poppadoms. Even better!

  text: I went there and it was really good. I had masala dosa and manchurian cauliflower
    for starters. Great flavours and textures. Then mushroom rice and a veggie curry.
    They had a lovely selection of vegetables in the curry rather than the usual menu
    standard ones. It was nice to be able to try different kinds of rice too. ðŸ˜‹" ...
    "They were lovely and really helpful!
