  text: So, we went to The Woodthorpe to check out their new vegan options. Got the
    chickpea and sweet potato curry and the veggie lasagne. Both decent pub grub!
    Then we tried the chocolate brownie and orange torte. So. Good. This place would
    be ideal for a Sunday afternoon with omni family members.
