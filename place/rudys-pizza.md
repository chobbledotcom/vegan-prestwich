  text: It‚Äôs ok, broccoli on a pizza is a bit odd ha! Personally I think the Croma
    pizzas are better üçï

  text: We really enjoyed it, they asked for feedback and we said we were disappointed
    that no dips were vegan and poor choices for desserts and starters but so is croma
    in that department.

  text: They have a vegan special on with vegan ‚Äúlamb‚Äù but I prefer to get the marinara
    (tomato and oregano) and add veggies such as peppers, artichokes etc

  text: I loved the broccoli on the pizza! Would have liked more. Wasn't sure about
    the vegan lamb though. Shame very limited starters and deserts!!

  text: I went last night and had the marinara (no cheese) and extra toppings. Got
    the chilli honey dipping sauce and it was delicious! Really nice inside- we had
    a great quick dinner with the kids.
