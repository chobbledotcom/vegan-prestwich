      favourite!! ðŸ˜ƒ)â€¦ But donâ€™t get the curry. It is rubbish.

      Mock duck is a great call, but I normally get salt and pepper mock chicken
      with an accompanying sauce of any description. Salt and Pepper chips are
      immense too


      I love the mock chicken in OK sauce. It's crispy mock chicken in that
      dish. Seaweed is also great. And the fried rice without egg. Brocolli
      black bean is also delicious

Also, it wasn't immediately obvious that they deliver - they do! And no confusion about what was and wasn't vegan - the person who answered the phone totally got it.

Highly recommended!"
