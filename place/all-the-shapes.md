  text: All The Shapes burrito is amazing. I actually asked the chef what was in it
    a few months ago, as I was blown away by it. Wish I could remember the details
    but it had something crunchy in, plus cashew cream.

  text: Having lunch at All The Shapes (Warwick Street). The Brasicca Bowl in here
    is probably my fave, and Stefan highly recommends today's vegan fruit cake 😀
