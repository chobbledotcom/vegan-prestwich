  text: 'It’s been a while since we ate at a Joseph Holts pub, and we’ve found their
    vegan provision has fluctuated a lot over the last few years. We popped into The
    Friendship for lunch recently though and were pleasantly surprised by the options!
    Pictured are some tasty vegan nachos and jackfruit wings, plus a sweet potato
    and bean chilli with vegan yogurt. It’s always handy to have a pub to take omni
    family to on a Sunday! '
