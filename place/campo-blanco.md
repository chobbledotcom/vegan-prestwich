[February 2024:](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3r5Sr4NRz6) "New menu alert! 🚨 Campo Blanco shaking some things up and adding a new vegan option: mushroom scallops! Have you tried them yet? We were impressed!"

[September 2023:](https://dumpoir.com/c/0051740412048571023) "New Campo Blanco menu! More beans and greens. Delicious! And especially good if, like me, you’re keeping an eye on your iron intake 👍"

[May 2023:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsEKvceN1fT) "@campoblanco have started opening for lunch, so we popped over to try one of their tapas bowls. At first glance it didn’t look like there was a lot of options for us, but cross referencing with the main menu we discovered that the chickpeas, mushrooms, and a couple of other dishes can be made vegan on request. We easily got a very good and filling feed! We’ll definitely be back 💚"

[December 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1816682708709137) "Tonight we ate at campo blanco in whitefield. The vegan options were great! We had hummus and flatbread, cauliflower wings (the nicest I’ve ever had!) garlic mushrooms, sticky sprouts and Patata‘s Bravas. Would highly recommend."

"I went here last week and meant to say the same. They had all the drinks marked as vegan etc as well. Very impressed"

"we also went to Campo Blanco tonight! it was divine. agreed that the cauliflower wings are the best ever. the hot chocolate liquor cocktails were also really good, and the booze is all labelled as mentioned! just a perfect meal all round"

[July 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cfjb18HNXzO) "A few highlights from a delicious meal of vegan tapas from [@campoblanco](https://www.instagram.com/campoblanco) in Whitefield the other night. Including possibly the best cauliflower wings we’ve ever had. Strong words, I know!"
