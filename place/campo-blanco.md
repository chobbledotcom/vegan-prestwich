  text: '@campoblanco have started opening for lunch, so we popped over to try one
    of their tapas bowls. At first glance it didn‚Äôt look like there was a lot of options
    for us, but cross referencing with the main menu we discovered that the chickpeas,
    mushrooms, and a couple of other dishes can be made vegan on request. We easily
    got a very good and filling feed! We‚Äôll definitely be back üíö'

  text: Tonight we ate at campo blanco in whitefield. The vegan options were great!
    We had hummus and flatbread, cauliflower wings (the nicest I‚Äôve ever had!) garlic
    mushrooms, sticky sprouts and Patata‚Äòs Bravas. Would highly recommend.

    as vegan etc as well. Very impressed
