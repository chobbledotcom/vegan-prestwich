  text: Vegan chicken fajitas and a plant based burger this afternoon @panama.hattys.prestwich
    - nice to find another lunch spot! Theyâ€™ve greatly improved the labelling on the
    menu since I was last in. Iâ€™m excited to come back and try the vegan Sunday roast
    option some time soon as well ðŸŒ±

    really impressed - it was properly delicious
