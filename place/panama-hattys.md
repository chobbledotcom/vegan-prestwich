      Vegan chicken fajitas and a plant based burger this afternoon @panama.hattys.prestwich
      - nice to find another lunch spot! They've greatly improved the labelling on the
      menu since I was last in. I'm excited to come back and try the vegan Sunday roast
      option some time soon as well 🌱

      I ate there yesterday! I had the vegan 'chicken' burrito and chips, and was
      really impressed - it was properly delicious
