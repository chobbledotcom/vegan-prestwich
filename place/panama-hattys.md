[January 2024:](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2FoNkbN9no/) "Vegan chicken fajitas and a plant based burger this afternoon @panama.hattys.prestwich - nice to find another lunch spot! They’ve greatly improved the labelling on the menu since I was last in. I’m excited to come back and try the vegan Sunday roast option some time soon as well 🌱"
