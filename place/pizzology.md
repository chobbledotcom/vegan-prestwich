  text: We ordered from these guys last night and it was really tasty! They have three
    vegan pizzas on the menu as well as make-your-own options, and a tasty vegan cheesecake
    option. They're Salford-based but they'll deliver to Prestwich <3

  text: I think they are great, because it means you can eat basically the same as
    your non vegan friends! We also ordered from them last night! They are a staple
    in our house

  text: There really good! I rang up a few weeks back to ask about cross contamination,
    the guy was super helpful and explained everything about how they prep vegan food,
    they have a separate station/prep area for vegan products which is amazing! Food
    was on time and very nice! Proper home cooked pizza! 💁🏻‍♀️🌱💚
