  text: really tasty pizza, falafel and hummus from Cuckoo's Prestwich the other day.
    they've got nice vegan cheese, but from past visits I know the cheese-less pizzas
    are also A++. great coffee, too!

    for lunch and got ourselves some delicious 'make your own' vegan pizzas. I went
    for olives and asparagus and my date chose peppers and wild mushrooms. Both very
    tasty with a lovely crispy base üçï

Vegan cheese on their pizzas is available on request, plus they have a few vegan options nibbles-wise - sweet potato fries, falafel, hummus, pitta etc.
