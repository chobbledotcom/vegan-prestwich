  text: Getting oat milk delivered to our doorstep in returnable glass bottles has
    been such a life upgrade. We ran out the other day (we always forget we need more
    for hot drinks when the weather turns chilly) and had to make do with supermarket
    oat milk. We were surprised by the drop in quality! And the price ðŸ«£ Highly recommend
    oat milk from Danny at Prestwich Milk Deliveries.
