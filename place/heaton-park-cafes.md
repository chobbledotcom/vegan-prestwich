  text: Sunny Sunday visit to Heaton Park meant we got to try the “Kickin Katsu” burger
    there for the first time. Pity me and my attempts to get a good picture! Burgers
    are hard. Hit the spot though 🍔

  text: '@heatonparkcafes have upped their vegan offerings again! We tried the scotch
    egg, the bbq Texas strip sandwich, and the chocolate and coconut tart. All great
    options and not the only ones available. Well impressed!'

  text: Nothing beats Heaton Park in the sun ☀️ and both big cafés have some great
    vegan options. There’s a mushroom pizza, a burger, usually some cake. For me it’s
    the soysage hot dog every time though 🌭
