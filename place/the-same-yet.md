  text: Vegan hot dog with a view at the Same Yet ☀️ This is a special they’ve got
    on at the moment but they do a tasty Thai vegan burger and hoisin mock duck wrap
    on their main menu as well.

  text: Just had a Guinness and a very tasty vegan 'Thai' burger from the lunch menu
    at The Same Yet down Simister Lane - they also had a vegan chickpea and cauliflower
    curry on their specials! And their staff were very friendly, too.
