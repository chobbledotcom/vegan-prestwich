  text: After getting a takeaway the other night we decided to try the dining in experience
    @chipsno8 - great stuff! I had the tempeh tacos and my date had the mushroom pie.
    Remember to ask for the chips to be vegan though as they do fry in animal fat
    by default! ðŸ˜¬ðŸ’š

  text: Chips and French mushroom pie with mushy peas and curry sauce from @chipsno8
    . Remember you have to ask for your chips in vegetable oil for them to be vegan.
    Worth the wait though - the curry sauce in particular was excellent! ðŸ’š

  text: Just wanted to give a shout out to Chips at No.8. I asked before on FB about
    what vegan options they do and they promptly let me know they offer a curried
    pea and potato pie as well as vegan battered sausage and vegan black pudding (the
    latter two are off menu so you need to ask). The gravy, curry sauce and mushy
    peas are all vegan too. The chips are fried in vegetable oil on request. A lot
    of thought goes into the packaging which isn't often the case with takeaways,
    avoiding plastic and using paper/vegware. Above all though, it's an excellent
    chippy and really tasty.

  text: Chips @ No.8 do a vegan pie, you have to ask for your chips to be done in
    oil (which they are happy to do and it says on the wall) because they use beef
    dripping otherwise
