Saffron Express on Bury Old Road is the best for an Indian. Before we went vegan we ordered from them regularly but since we’ve gone vegan, they’ve been really accommodating and they’ll talk you through the menu and what you’ve ordered and let you know if it’s vegan or can be made vegan. The food arrives quickly, is very reasonably priced and is so delicious and they always label it ‘no ghee’ etc. Highly recommend ☺️
