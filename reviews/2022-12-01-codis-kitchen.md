had a scrumptious takeaway from Codi's Kitchen on Heywood Road tonight - really flavoursome with generous portions. their food is similar to Unagi from Deliveroo (also very fit Asian food, highly recommended), except local so it gets home hotter, and less expensive, and with less plastic, but just as delicious I reckon!

the tofu poke bowl (very nice and light and varied), the pumpkin katsu curry (rich sauce and really tasty sweet innards), the mushroom karaage bao bun (fit! lovely and crispy and spiced) and the salt and pepper chips (pretty good). I've also had the vegan sushi and liked it
