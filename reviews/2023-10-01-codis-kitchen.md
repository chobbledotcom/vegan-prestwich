We often order from Codi's for takeaway but this was my first time eating in. The place is really sweet and the food is even better in situ! We had the pumpkin katsu, the mushroom karage, bang bang cauliflower and one of this weeks specials: the tofu sliders (alerted to use a bao style bun instead of the non vegan brioche)
