It’s been a while since we ate at a Joseph Holts pub, and we’ve found their vegan provision has fluctuated a lot over the last few years. We popped into The Friendship for lunch recently though and were pleasantly surprised by the options! Pictured are some tasty vegan nachos and jackfruit wings, plus a sweet potato and bean chilli with vegan yogurt. It’s always handy to have a pub to take omni family to on a Sunday!
