Just been to the Prestwich Makers Market . My favourite stalls are ICED, The Samosa Man and now added Rachael's Bakes to the list. Rachael makes amazing vegan cookies in flavours like maple and pecan, apple pie, chocolate, raspberry and white chocolate. I'm working my way through the flavours!!! If you're planning a visit its really busy there.
