We've had a few fruit & veg boxes over the last few weeks from Village Greens Prestwich and I highly recommend them - the diversity of veg has forced us to be more creative with our lockdown cooking, it's available when supermarket deliveries aren't, it supports a local cooperative business, you get a good amount for your money, and there's no plastic either <3
