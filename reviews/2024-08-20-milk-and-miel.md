Feel like I should shout out Milk & Miel for being consistently ace, I've been there loads recently, can't get enough of their avocado toast and seasoned potatoes but the vegan breakfast is also A++ and they've had some really nice cakes lately. Our dog is a big fan of there too and drags me over if she we walk near it, cuz they always give her a bit of fuss.
