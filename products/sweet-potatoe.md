    text: Picked up lunch from Sweet Potatoe opposite Besse's, as recommended in here the other day - well tasty! And you get sooo much for your money. Highly recommend the three bean chilli.

    text: Prestwich-adjacent. New potato place near Besses has plenty of vegan options including vegan cheese, chilli, bolognese and curry and you can have a regular or sweet potato. Pretty decent and large portions.
