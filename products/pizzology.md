    text: We ordered from these guys last night and it was really tasty! They have three vegan pizzas on the menu as well as make-your-own options, and a tasty vegan cheesecake option. They're Salford-based but they'll deliver to Prestwich <3

    text: I think they are great, because it means you can eat basically the same as your non vegan friends! We also ordered from them last night! They are a staple in our house

    text: There really good! I rang up a few weeks back to ask about cross contamination, the guy was super helpful and explained everything about how they prep vegan food, they have a separate station/prep area for vegan products which is amazing! Food was on time and very nice! Proper home cooked pizza! 💁🏻‍♀️🌱💚
