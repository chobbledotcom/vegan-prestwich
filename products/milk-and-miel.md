      Feel like I should shout out Milk & Miel for being consistently ace, I've
      been there loads recently, can't get enough of their avocado toast and seasoned
      potatoes but the vegan breakfast is also A++ and they've had some really nice
      cakes lately. Our dog is a big fan of there too and drags me over if she we walk
      near it, cuz they always give her a bit of fuss.

      "@milkmieluk have only got vegan mayo in little packets! I didn't even know
      these existed. Also I continue to be blown away by the shroom toast 💚"

      "@milkmieluk have a fancy new menu! Quite a few good vegan options, both sweet
      and savoury. We tried the shroom toast and the avocado smash. Both were lovely
      though mushrooms were especially delicious."
