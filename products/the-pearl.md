    text: Stunning Sunday lunch @thepearlmcr this afternoon 😍 We got in contact before we booked as we’ve been burned before with fine dining places not catering to vegans. The response we got was such a warm welcome. They have a continually evolving menu of seasonal dishes with locally sourced ingredients. Four courses on offer and they say at least one option for each will be able to be made vegan 🌱 Thanks guys, we’ll definitely be in again!
