    text: Took a friend out for lunch at @alltheshapesmcr . I’m basically always craving their vegan burrito and the new vegan burger is an exciting addition!

    text: Couldn’t choose between The Other Breakfast and Eddie’s Burrito at @alltheshapesmcr so we didn’t! Both delicious, we can attest 😋

    text: All The Shapes burrito is amazing. I actually asked the chef what was in it a few months ago, as I was blown away by it. Wish I could remember the details but it had something crunchy in, plus cashew cream.

    text: Having lunch at All The Shapes (Warwick Street). The Brasicca Bowl in here is probably my fave, and Stefan highly recommends today's vegan fruit cake 😀
