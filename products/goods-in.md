  text: We popped in to @thegoodsinmcr to try their new vegan special. Really great,
    exciting flavours and as usual they had the biscoff tarts on the counter for dessert.
    Try it while you can!

  text: 'Friends! You really need to come down to @thegoodsinmcr some weekend evening
    and try the @thechaatwalas take over menu. So, so delicious. It’s on Thursday,
    Friday, Saturday for the next 6 weeks. Best part: the menu is 100% vegan 🌱 Pictured
    are the Dahi Puri, Sev Puri, Keema Fries, and Samosa Chaat. We got this combo
    for £25!'

  text: The Goods In have done a little shake up of their daytime menu, adding a handful
    of vegan sides and a new main - cauliflower shawarma! So good. Stiff competition
    for their vegan breakfast options.

  text: Managed to get some of those Goods In tacos after getting turned away last
    weekend! This weekend we got the last of the cauliflower - clearly the veegs are
    coming out in force to try these. Well worth the wait. The chilli was particularly
    flavourful and the taco shells were just the right amount of crunch. They’re available
    every weekend but remember to book!

  text: Goods In serving up some excellent Christmas pudding shaped vegan cookies
    this week! They taste like a chocolate brownie but in a biscuit, ie excellent.
    We’ve heard rumours of the return of vegan snowman muffins as well but you’ll
    have to be quick off the draw to get one!

    this afternoon! I can never resist a dark choc and sea salt cookie, and the lemon
    and blueberry cake was gooey delicious 💕

  text: I did have a fantastic vegan breakfast at The Goods Inn last week. Really
    imaginative food, put together with thought, rather than just the standard replacing
    individual items with vegan sausages etc. The menu said their sausages are homemade
    and I'd love to know what is in them. They were gorgeous.

  text: There's a new vegan-friendly hipster bar opposite Heaton Park Metrolink stop,
    'The Goods In' - popped in there last weekend and had a very delicious vegan 'hoagie'
    sandwich, fried nibbles, a plant milk chai, and a fancy IPA. Recommended!
