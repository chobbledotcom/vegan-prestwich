  text: Just been to the Prestwich Makers Market . My favourite stalls are ICED, The
    Samosa Man and now added Rachael's Bakes to the list. Rachael makes amazing vegan
    cookies in flavours like maple and pecan, apple pie, chocolate, raspberry and
    white chocolate. I'm working my way through the flavours!!! If you're planning
    a visit its really busy there.

Just picked up my vegan yule log from Iced at the Makers Market. It's got fresh cream inside and supercute mushrooms and hedgehogs. It's freezable and you can get it by the slice!
Not sure its going to make it to Christmas!!"

"cuuuute!
I got so much stuff at the market today - samosas from the samosa man, three cakes from teatime collective, two pasties from iced, vegan natas from that natas dude, hot sauces from elliot eastwicks..
pity the vegan baklava guy wasn't there but otherwise, an excellent haul"
