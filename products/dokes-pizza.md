  text: We went to Dokes for a vegan roast. The roast vegetables and greens were really
    good.The broccoli was perfectly cooked but came in a sauce I didn't like. The
    nut roast was a bit sloppy but tasted good. A bit pricier than Place and Palette
    but worth a visit!

  text: Finally got myself back to @dokesprestwich this weekend! Last time I went
    was right after they opened. Seems like the menu has been streamlined a bit. They’ve
    got this lovely mushroom and truffle oil pizza as a vegan option, and are willing
    to adapt their other options with vegan cheese and topping substitutions. I have
    to say this pizza was delicious though, so I’d happily have it again!

    it’s the best Vegan Pizza I’ve found in 3 years !

  text: Dokes Pizzeria is incredible, been there twice already. They don't have vegan
    cheese (who even likes that stuff?!) but an incredible choice of vegan options
    and not just pizza

  text: 'Welcome to Prestwich, @dokesprestwich! We popped in the other day and had
    some really tasty pizza and sides. Seems like the staff are still getting the
    hang of the menu, but they were happy to check on the vegan-ness of their options.
    We got there in the end and there was plenty for us to choose from. Thanks guys! '

They absolutely nailed it!
So get your pizza on and try that place out pronto!
Oh and I'm not on commission! 🤣
P.s. ate the food too quick to take a pic of it, but here's the lovely venue instead!"
