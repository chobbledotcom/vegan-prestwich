    text: Went to Remal yesterday in the village. Very limited vegan options but everything is clearly labelled and very tasty ( the falafel isn’t vegan and was my friends). We went super early so it was less busy for us.

    text: They will make vegan bread if they know someone is vegan. The green beans in tomato sauce is lovely 👌
