Really good 'free from' vegan food sections all over the shop, good vegan cheeses and non-dairy milks, lots of veggie options in the freezers too.

Tesco does not support, commission or carry out animal testing on any of their own-brand products or their ingredients, nor do suppliers on their behalf.
