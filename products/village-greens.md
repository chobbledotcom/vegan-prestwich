    No word of a lie: one of the finest toasties I’ve had ever.'

  text: I used to love lemon meringue pie. Not had it for years. Just been in Village
    Greens and, lo and behold, there’s a vegan lemon meringue pie in the chiller.
    Just scoffing it now - yummy!

  text: We've had a few fruit & veg boxes over the last few weeks from Village Greens
    Prestwich and I highly recommend them - the diversity of veg has forced us to
    be more creative with our lockdown cooking, it's available when supermarket deliveries
    aren't, it supports a local cooperative business, you get a good amount for your
    money, and there's no plastic either <3

Loads of veggie / organic options, fresh hot and cold food, very little plastic on the vegetables and pulses, and you can take your empty grains, pasta, rice, soap, shampoo bottles etc to be refilled!
