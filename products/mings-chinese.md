  - text: Mock duck is a great call, but I normally get salt and pepper mock chicken with an accompanying sauce of any description. Salt and Pepper chips are immense too.

  - text: I love the mock chicken in OK sauce. It's crispy mock chicken in that dish. Seaweed is also great. And the fried rice without egg. Brocolli black bean is also delicious.

  - text: We have ordered from Mings and it is just as good as Won Sheng (our other favourite!!)... But don't get the curry. It is rubbish.
