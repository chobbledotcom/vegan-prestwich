    text: Would like to recommend Coco’s Cuisine Mcr - based in prestwich for delivery and she has a separate vegan menu. We ordered on Christmas Eve and again tonight so have now eaten our way through most of the vegan menu. The foccacia, tagliatelle, shepherds pie and all of the deserts have been spot on in particular 👌🏻
