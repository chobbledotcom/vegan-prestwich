  text: We went to Lupo Cafe today, a tiny authentic Italian cafe hidden away on an industrial estate in Sedgley Park - it was well good! There weren't loads of vegan options on the menu but there are a few, and the things we had were properly delicious - aside from the vegano pizza and penne arabiata, we had the charred peppers, the salad, and some really nice coffees. Sadly they didn't have any vegan desserts beyond sorbet - the non-vegan pastries and stuff they had looked really nice and indulgent
